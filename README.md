The AirBnB clone project involved the development of a command-line interpreter to manage AirBnB objects, laying the foundation for subsequent web application functionalities. This initial step was crucial for integrating HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API, and frontend components in future stages. The project implemented a parent class, BaseModel, responsible for initializing, serializing, and deserializing instances, facilitating a seamless flow of data between instances, dictionaries, JSON strings, and files. Additionally, it entailed the creation of specific classes (e.g., User, State, City, Place) inheriting from BaseModel, and the establishment of a file storage engine. Comprehensive unit tests were conducted to validate all classes and storage functionalities. The command interpreter enabled operations such as creating, retrieving, updating, and destroying objects, mirroring the functionality of a limited-use Shell tailored to the project's requirements.
